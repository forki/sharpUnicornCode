## Mission

This project is built with a strict purpose of building from the command line on Linux, OS-X, or Windows. The idea being that it can be developed across any of these operating systems without being limited to Windows and Visual Studio.

To build this project execute the build process with the build file. If you're using Windows the build file will be called build.cmd.

    build.sh

The basis of this project will be centered around building, test execution, and even deployment using this build script and only items in the project that can be executed from the command line.
